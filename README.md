# GasStationEfficiency
This is my first self-driven developed android app, it  calculates the cost of two gas stations, taking into account the driving cost and the cost of filling up, based on the vehicle's MPG. The app then determines which station is the more economical choice.


This app can be found on the google play store for review/use, and it will be expanded upon as the time comes.

There are plans to implement API calls to vehicle databases for MPG of a given make-model-year,
although I've yet to find a fuel tank size stat from these databases.
This may lead to a permanent requirement of the user having to know how many gallons they put in their tank.
There are also plans to implement API calls to gasbuddy, or a bridge to grab information from two gas stations, via gas buddy, chosen by the user.
